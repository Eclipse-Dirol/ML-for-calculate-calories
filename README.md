Model for calculate calories
This is an incredible project that I've been working on. I've finished this project, and it's likely to be updated from time to time, but that's not guaranteed. It was a pet project to understand how models are brought into production. How fully connected networks are built and how the first systems for my models are created. To go to the site and see the answers: https://lepidopterous-inertly-jazmine.ngrok-free.dev 
I will keep the site online whenever possible, but not always.
